Python List Comprehension

Python list comprehensions provide a concise way for creating lists. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses: [EXPRESSION for ITEM in LIST <if CONDITIONAL>].

The expressions can be anything - any kind of object can go into a list.

A list comprehension always returns a list.


# List comprehension for the squares of all even numbers between 0 and 9
result = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
 
print(result)
# [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
