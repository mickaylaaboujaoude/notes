Combining Categories in Python


import pandas as pd
 
# read in data
election_data = pd.read_csv('election_data.csv')
 
# get the counts for each candidate
votes = election_data['Vote'].value_counts()
print(votes)

it makes sense to collapse the other candidates into a category called “Other."

How can we do this in Python? We can create a mask for values occurring less than a specific number of times in votes. In our case, we’ll check for values occurring less than 200 times. We do this using the isin() function:

mask = election_data.isin(votes[votes < 200].index)

election_data[mask] = 'Other' #label these categories as "Other"
print(election_data['Vote'].value_counts()) #print the updated vote count
