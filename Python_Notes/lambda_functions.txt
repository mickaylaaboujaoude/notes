Python Lambda Functions
A function is an object that is able to accept some sort of input, possibly modify it, and return some sort of output. In Python, a lambda function is a one-line shorthand for function. A simple lambda function might look like this:
add_two = lambda my_input: my_input + 2


With if statements

<WHAT TO RETURN IF STATEMENT IS TRUE> if <IF STATEMENT> else <WHAT TO RETURN IF STATEMENT IS FALSE>

check_if_A_grade = lambda grade: 'Got an A!' if grade >= 90 else 'Did not get an A...'



Lambda functions only work if we’re just doing a one line command. If we wanted to something longer, we’d need a more complex function. Lambda functions are great when you need to use a function once. Because you aren’t defining a function, the reusability aspect functions is not present with lambda functions
